# Web-Scraper

## Description

The `web-scraper` repository contains a collection of web scraping scripts, each tailored for a specific website. These scripts are part of my learning journey in web scraping and may not be fully mature yet. They serve as a great resource for beginners in this field.

Each directory within the repository focuses on a website-specific scraping script. You'll find a `requirement.txt` file in each directory, listing all the dependencies needed to run the scripts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. Then, install the dependencies for each script using the following command:

pip install -r requirement.txt

### Running the Scripts

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the scraping scripts to fetch data from the specified websites. Typically, you would run a script like this:

python scraper_script.py

Replace `scraper_script.py` with the actual script file you wish to run.

## Contribution

As a learning project, contributions from other developers are highly welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvement or want to add new scraping scripts, feel free to submit a pull request.
