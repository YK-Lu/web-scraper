# FoodPanda Restaurant and Menu Scraper

## Overview

This project facilitates the scraping of restaurant and menu information from the FoodPanda platform. It includes two scripts:

- `restaurant_scrapey.py`: Scrapes data about restaurants.
- `menu_scraper.py`: Uses the data obtained from `restaurant_scrapey.py` to scrape menu information from these restaurants.

The workflow begins with `restaurant_scrapey.py`, gathering essential details about various restaurants. Once this data is collected, `menu_scraper.py` proceeds to extract detailed menu information based on the collected restaurant data.

## Directory Structure

The project may create and use the following directories (if not already present) for storing data, logs, and backups:

- `./food_img`: Stores downloaded images.
- `./error`: Contains logs of any errors encountered.
- `./backup`: Holds backup data files.
- `./crawled_vendors`: Keeps track of vendors that have been crawled.

These directories are crucial for the organized storage of data and logs generated by the scripts.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/foodpanda-scraper.git
cd foodpanda-scraper
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Start by running the restaurant scraper:

```bash
python restaurant_scrapey.py
```

After collecting restaurant data, proceed with the menu scraper:

```bash
python menu_scraper.py
```

The scripts will save the scraped data in the respective directories.
